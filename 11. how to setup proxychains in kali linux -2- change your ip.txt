HOW TO SETUP PROXYCHAINS IN KALI LINUX -2- CHANGE YOUR IP
=========================================================

- why use nano editor?
this is as beginner friendly as possible

- open your proxychains.conf file:
> nano /etc/proxychains.conf

dynamic_chain --> turn this on
this is gonna make your ip change in a very dynamic manner

strict_chain --> this is gonna go through a series of ips
but this is gonna be easier to detect because this ip is
gonna be repeating themselves

random_chain --> this is the worse, because this is 
gonna use random proxy meaning if one of your proxies is not working
you're bassically stumped

Proxy DNS request --> uncomment this too
this is gonna prevent dns data leaking 
(very important)

- in the example proxies:
we're gonna use the socks5 because it's the 
safest and the fastest

in the example:
socks5  192.168.67.78   1080    lamer   secret

note:
192.168.67.78 --> proxy's ip address
1080 --> port
lamer --> example username
secret --> password example

- we're gonna use tor and the proxy chains together
how we're gonna do that?
[proxyList] --> this is where we're gonna set our proxies
this is the default:

socks4  127.0.0.1 9050

note:
the default is set to "tor"
but we're not gonna use that 

instead of removing that, we're gonna use this one:
just below the default one (socks4  127.0.0.1 9050)
add this:
socks5  127.0.0.1   9050

note:
for spacing use [tab] key 
127.0.0.1 --> this is the basic tor config ip which is bassically your ip 
and this is gonna test whether the proxy chains are working or not

now save the file!

- checking our configured proxy:
checking if the tor service is running or not:
> service tor status

if it's running do this:
> service tor stop

to start the proxy:
> service tor start

now we're gonna begin with the proxy chains:
we're gonna be using the tor proxy with
the proxy chains configuration file

> proxychains firefox www.duckduckgo.com

note:
this is gonna run the proxychains for firefox and duckduckgo

firefox is also called iceweasel
www.duckduckgo.com --> this is the test website
duckduckgo is not gonna track your ip address
if you wanna do something like who is scan, 
you just have to use duckduckgo!

after you press enter, this is gonna start the proxy chains

then open duckduckgo 

how do you know that you're anonymous?
we're gonna check for dns leaks

how to check dns leaks?
just search duckduckgo --> check for dns leaks

then click the dns leak test

JUST RESTART THE STEP!
how do you know this is working and our ip will be changing?
> service tor restart

note:
this is gonna restart the tor service

after that run the previous command:
> proxychains firefox www.duckduckgo.com

then in duck2go you check for your dns leaks!
