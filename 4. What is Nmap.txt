WHAT IS NMAP 
============

- nmap is a footprinting tool (reconnaissance tool)
which is the first step of hacking 
(finding information about the target)

- nmap is a must have 

- this is available on all platforms 
https://nmap.org/

HOW TO OPEN NMAP 
----------------
- first you can open it using the ui 

- the second is using the terminal:
> nmap --help 
note:
this is gonna show all the options available with nmap

USING THE NMAP 
--------------

- WARNING: NMAP IS A VERY VERY NOISY SCANNER:
this is easily detectable by firewalls and servers 

- it's about how to use nmap anonymously!

- this is where you can try scanning:
http://scanme.nmap.org/

note:
try not to hammer the server too hard
a few scans in one day is fine, don't do like 100 
scans a day!

EXAMPLE OF NMAP 
---------------

> nmap -v -A scanme.nmap.org 

note:
-v --> this is the version or the address name 
-A --> enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning 

> nmap -v -sn 192.168.0.0/16

note:
- weird ip configuration:
192.168.0.0/16
this is a range of ip addresses


INFORMATION ABOUT IP ADDRESSES
------------------------------

- you wanna search "major ip block"
https://www.nirsoft.net/countryip/

note:
these are all the ip ranges from every country 
around the world

important about reconnaissance:
ip address means you can do a lot with it 
and you can find lots of information related to that ip address 

- you can see more of ip address information by searching:
"who is [ip address]"

- here's one site about the geo location of an ip address:
http://geoiplookup.net/

NSLOOKUP 
--------

> nslookup http://scanme.nmap.org/
note:
this is available on windows (no need to install)

- this is gonna give you the address of the website
36.86.63.182

- you can save the information about this in a document by this command:
> nslookup http://scanme.nmap.org/ >> results.txt
