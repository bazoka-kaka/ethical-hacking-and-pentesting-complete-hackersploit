NMAP TUTORIAL -3- AGGRESSIVE SCANNING
=====================================

> nmap -A scanme.nmap.org
note:
-A --> this is aggressive scan meaning you are gonna get the operating system 
this scan is gonna scan 1000 ports by default 

- if you wanna get the service version 
of the services that are running
example: version of os 

> nmap -sV scanme.nmap.org 

-sV --> this means the service version 

- why is this useful?
you can find vulnerability for each
services on certain version

- if you only wanna scan for the important ports:
> nmap -F scanme.nmap.org

note:
-F --> this means fast which bassically gives you 
the most commonly targeted ports

note:
this is not going through 1000 ports, but only the ports 
that are common which is a good practice

- you can scan more than one in a row:
> nmap -F scanme.nmap.org www.google.com > /home/bazoka-kaka/Desktop/scan.txt

- you can also scan for ip address:
> nmap -F 192.168.1.0-225 www.google.com

- to scan only for the open ports:
> nmap --open www.google.com > ~/Desktop/scan.txt
