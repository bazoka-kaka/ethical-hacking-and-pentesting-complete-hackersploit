How To Setup Proxychains In Kali Linux - #1 - Stay Anonymous
============================================================

- we're gonna make a proxy chains 

- what is are proxy chains?
proxy chains are a series of proxies
that will give you anonymity or will anonymize
everything that you're doing 
whether you're doing nmap, bruteforce, sql injection, 
or just browsing the web 

- what is the difference between proxy and proxy chains?
proxies are bassically found in browsers they bassically 
anonymize http connections or web connections or things
that you're doing on the internet

proxychains are gonna anonymize everything that you're doing

- when using the pentesting distros, proxychains
are already installed

- configuring the proxy chains:
open the terminal
to configure the proxy chains, you 
should have the proxy chains.configuration file
which is in this dir:
> nano /etc/proxychains.conf

# --> this is just comments in the config file
http, socks4, socks5, tunneling proxifier with dns 
note:
http, socks4, socks5 are just bassically the format
of proxies

socks5 --> this is the reccommended one!

dynamic_chain --> this is the MOST IMPORTANT!
this is the fastest and the most stable proxies tha tyou can find
the difference between a dynamic and strict or
a random chain 

random_chain --> this is gonna use your ip address
your proxies are not active 

to activate a proxy:
just remove the hash!

now remove the hash that is besides the dynamic_chain 

meaning you're using a proxy right now!

so dynamic_chain --> this is gonna go to different ip addresses
or proxies in different countries 
this is not gonna go through dead proxies 
and at least one proxy must be online

strict_chain --> this is gonna stick to the ip that you've given
or the proxies that you've given and this is gonna only use one of the proxies

proxy_dns --> 

when you're anonymizing a system, you can use a proxy
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR DNS!

why?
most beginners, they are gonna change their ips every 
some minutes, but the dns is still the same, 
meaning the dns is still in the country that you are in

example:
if you access youtube, it's gonna lock your ip
and you haven't changed your dns 
so your dns will show your host country
youtube will know what your home country is!
this is because youtube will know that you're
using different ips, but your dns it still the same
which is the country that you are in!

ALWAYS CHANGE YOUR DNS BECAUSE THIS IS GONNA INCREASE
YOUR ANONYMITY!
