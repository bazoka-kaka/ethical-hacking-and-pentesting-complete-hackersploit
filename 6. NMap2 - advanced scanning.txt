ADVANCED SCANNING 
=================

> nmap --help 
note:
this is gonna show all the things that you can do using nmap 

> nmap scanme.nmap.org 
note:
this is gonna show all of the available ports that is in scanme.nmap.org 

by default, nmap will scan a thousand ports 
that's why it's taking like 15 seconds to do that 

not shown --> this is the closed ports 

you can do the calculation: 1000-notShown 

this is gonna output the shown ports 

- state is gonna be open or filtered 
note:
filtered --> meaning nmap can't determine whether the port 
is open or closed (you wanna stay away from that)

SAVING THE SCAN RESULTS 
-----------------------

importance:
if you're gonna do the massive scan on websites, ip, etc 
this is gonna take time and lots of data 
they could do lots of mistakes for example, like closing by mistake 
after hours of retrieving data and they're gone!

note:
it's a good practice to save every scan!

SCANNING 
--------

retrieving our router's subnet:
> ifconfig 
note:
this is gonna show you the interface used 
and the ip address plus another infos 

> nmap -oG 192.168.1.0-255 -vv 
note:
here we're using a special type of output called a grippable 
output which is bassically just a document 
but it just sorts the data very2 neatly 
using -oG

-vv --> this is giving you more information
