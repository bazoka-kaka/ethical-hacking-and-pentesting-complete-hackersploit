INSTALLING PARROT OS 
==================== 

- this is the alternative for kali linux 
- this is a good looking distro 
- kali linux is not really nice with older hardwares 
- parrot is running on ubuntu matte desktop 
env 
- in the applications section:
anon surf --> anonymous mode start 
note:
this is gonna use the tor proxies 
and will make you anonymous

you are gonan be able to change your location 
and browse anonymously 

if you're learning deepweb, this is 
a recommended distro to learn from 

this is focused on anonymity, 
cryptography, and ethical hacking 

- this has everything that kali linux has 
even more!

- this has a task manager (in linux we call that system monitor)

- good things:
1. lightweight 
2. good user interface 
3. it has more tools 
like anonymous serve 
(you just have to click it without doing anything and boom)
4. ultra stable
